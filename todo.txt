I started implementing the title screen (Badly and is just placeholder) along with a retry screen. I think I need to do some test projects to make a good ui. Might just make it magically restart if you press R after dying.

General:
  * Hey, we shouldn't repeate code. Find a way share common methods.
  * create a title screen
  * Create a way to retry without relaunching the game
  * Display the score ya dummy
  * partical effects pls

I started implementing the title screen (Badly and is just placeholder) along with a retry screen. I think I need to do some test projects to make a good ui. Might just make it magically restart if you press R after dying.

General:
  * find a typeface that is royalty free
  * create a title screen
  * Stage wide bombs is an easy thing I could do.
  * Add a background color
  * try other shapes
  * rotate shapes during movement
  * It'd be cool to have the score from killing an enemy display on the stage for 2-5 seconds where the enemy fell
  * It might be cool if you press a button and a line starts to be dropped behind the character. Once you create a loop (just a polygon) the shape solidifies and any enemies within die. Also could be cool as it would change the flow of the stage since enemies would now have to go around something to get to you. A simplier version might just be dropping a circle on your location and as soon as you leave it, it solidifies. I would also imagine that a second instance of this power would erase the initial instance. Might also need to add cooldown etc.
